## COURSE DESCRIPTION

Computer Programming 1 is a 3-unit core course that introduces learners to the first few steps of the software development cycle (planning, analysis, design, implementation, and testing). This course emphasizes the use of problem-solving competencies and the application of basic concepts and techniques of Java programming.  The learnings and insights from this course allow the learners to practice and develop the competencies required to succeed in more complex courses, and eventually thrive in the information technology industry.


## COURSE OUTCOMES

Identify, plan, and prioritize the development of tasks according to urgency, dependencies, and importance.
Capture, interpret, and convert business requirements into system or solution requirements.
Create, modify, test, and debug software following client requirements and using the Java programming language.

## TERMINAL ASSESSMENT AND MILESTONES

Learners use Java to write code that displays an employeeâ€™s basic information, timesheet, and salary. The learners are equipped to perform this final output through the following milestones:

Documentation of requirements that include process flow diagrams, wireframes/mockups, and project plan.
Development of required code modules.
Enhancement and debugging of required codes post-quality assurance testing.
