Task 11: Commit your Code to Github

1.  Work with your team to finalize your code. After going through team discussions the last couple of weeks, 
    your group should be working on the same code at this time.

2.  Decide who among you will host the main code (main branch). 

    1.  The host should:
        a. Create a repository for the project. Follow the naming convention MO-IT101-Group (e.g., MO-IT101-Group1).
        b. Commit the latest version of the code.
        c. Add the rest of the team as collaborators.
    
    2.  Collaborators should:
        a. Clone the committed code from GitHub to their Netbeans applications. 

 3. Access this folder and locate your class file.
    
    1. Add your GitHub username/email address beside your name.
    
    2. Locate the members of the group who will review your code and invite them to your repository as collaborators.
