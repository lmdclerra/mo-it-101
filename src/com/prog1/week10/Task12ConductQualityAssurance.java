/* Quality Assurance Test Cases


Similar to what you created when you conducted unit testing, quality assurance test cases define the conditions or 
variables that will determine whether the system satisfies requirements or works correctly. 

Test cases are identified in a test document. The format of test documents varies per organization. It depends on 
what is being tested, the standards followed, and the development process followed. It can be as comprehensive as 
a project plan, providing the information needed to estimate the effort needed for testing, establish coverage or scope, 
and track resources and progress. It can also be as specific or limited to a particular test scenario.

A test scenario is any functionality that can be tested. These reflect real-world scenarios that an end user is 
expected to do or may do. Let’s use an example.

The image shown above is a screenshot of the Facebook login page. What test scenarios/end-user actions may happen here? 
Since this is a login page, one test scenario could be to check the login functionality.

What test cases can you use when checking if a login functionality works? Examples could be:

>> Log in with valid credentials
>> Log in with a valid username but invalid password
>> Log in with an invalid username but valid password
>> Click the login button without entering any username or password
>> Click the forgot username link
>> Click the forgot password link

As you saw in the examples, test cases further expand a particular test scenario. Test cases should be:

>> easy to understand - anyone from the team should be able to pick up and perform the test
>> credible - something that could happen in the real world or something that end users may do
>> easy to evaluate - test results should be easy to evaluate as to whether they work (pass) or not (fail) 

Now, identifying test scenarios for a login page can be simple. But what about test scenarios after logging in to Facebook?

How many test scenarios can you think of by simply looking at this image? Probably a lot! Based on the login page example, 
you know that one scenario may end up with more than five test cases. How will you manage test scenario creation 
so you don’t end up with a lengthy test document?

This is where the importance of requirements gathering comes in. Use your requirements document and use case diagrams 
to identify the relevant items that need to be tested. For each requirement, identify possible user actions and 
why they need or would do those. These will serve as your reference for test scenarios. From there, 
define the specific test case per test scenario. Finally, check your project plan so you can schedule 
the testing around when specific modules or sections are completed.

Now that you know more about test cases, it’s time for you to practice filling out a test document. 
Here are some parameters for this activity:

Typical QA test documents are comprehensive; however, in this course, you only need to focus on certain sections.
QA testing is normally performed on applications or products with a finished UI (user interface). In this course, 
you just need to check whether the code can accomplish the required functions.

- Click this link (Copy of MO-IT101 _ Quality Assurance Testing.ods) to create a copy of the Quality Assurance Testing template.
- Fill out the required details. Refer to your team’s output from Milestone 1 to define the relevant test scenarios and 
  test cases. If you’d like to include any additional information, feel free to do so.

Task 12: Conduct Quality Assurance

Now that you have a test document, it’s time to practice conducting it. 

As the code owner:

1.  Locate your class file in this folder. 
2.  Take note of the group numbers indicated under columns E and F to the right of your name. 
    These are the groups that will review your code. 
3.  Locate the github username/email addresses of the members of the groups assigned to you by 
    filtering the file by group number.
4.  Add them as collaborators to your repository.

As the code reviewer:

1.  By this time, the group you’re assigned to should have invited you as a collaborator on their GitHub repository. 
    If they haven’t, reach out to them by referring to the assignments in the QA Review Assignment document so they 
    can send the invitation.
2.  Clone the group’s code into your Netbeans application. If you need a refresher on how to do this, 
    access Task 11 instructions from Week 9.
3.  Conduct testing following your QA test plan.
4.  Once you’re done, check with the rest of your team to see if your test results are consistent. 
    Repeat testing for test cases where the team’s results are different.
5.  Once the team’s results are consistent, choose whose file will be shared with the other group. 
6.  Share the completed QA document (through the Share function or email) with the members of the group whose code you tested. 


Don’t hesitate to reach out to your classmates or schedule a mentoring session should you have questions or clarifications about the task.
