Most IDEs have built-in debuggers. A debugger is a program that allows you to go through a program one line at a time 
to help you identify incorrect code and help you visualize how the code flows or executes. It gives you an idea of 
how a computer runs your code.

- how the program flows
- how variables are created
- how data is stored in each variable
- how functions are executed
- how calculations are made
- how control structures are executed (e.g., if else statements)

When working with a debugger, you need to be familiar with the following terms:

- Current Line - A computer processes code one line at a time. The code being processed at the time of execution 
  is called the current line. A program typically flows from the current line to the next, with the exception of 
  the use of conditional statements (like if-else statements).

- Breakpoint - As mentioned earlier, a debugger is also a program. That means it will start running at the beginning of 
  the code and will end once it completes or there is an error. Once you find out the possible cause of an issue, 
  you can specify a breakpoint. This tells the debugger to stop executing the program on this line so you can 
  further investigate.

- Step - This tells the debugger to go through the program one line at a time. It will halt the execution after 
  each line so you can look at each line of code as the program executes.
