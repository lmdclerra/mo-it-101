Task 13: Debug your Code

By this time, you should have received an update from the group that did QA testing on your team’s code. 
Review the results and check if the reviewers identified any bugs. 

If they identified bugs or items for fixing:

1.  how the program flows
2.  how variables are created
3.  how data is stored in each variable
4.  how functions are executed

If they did not find bugs or items for fixing:

1.  Use this time to improve your team’s code based on what you know now and the best practices you 
    discovered from reviewing another team’s code. 
2.  Meet with your team to discuss improvements you’d like to implement.
3.  If the team is okay with recommended improvements, pull the most recent code from GitHub to your NetBeans application.
4.  Update or enhance your code. Use comments to specify changes made.
5.  Once you’re done, commit the changes to GitHub and merge it with your main code
