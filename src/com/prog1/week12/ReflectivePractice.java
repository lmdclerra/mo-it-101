Reflective Practice

Being a lifelong learner is one of the attitudes that define a great developer. One way to achieve this is through 
reflective practice. Reflective practice allows you to integrate theory and practice. It stems from executing or 
applying a skill, reflecting on the experience (e.g., identifying what could be done better, identifying alternatives, 
pondering on the effectiveness of choices and decisions), and using the results of that reflection to improve 
how they execute or apply the same skill in the future.

If youâ€™d like to learn more about how reflection can help you as a software developer,
